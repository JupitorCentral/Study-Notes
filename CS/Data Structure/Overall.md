1. Linear Data Structures
	- Array
		- Fixed-size collection of elements stored contiguously.
		- Examples: Static arrays, dynamic arrays (e.g., ArrayList in Java).
	- Linked List
		- Sequence of nodes where each node points to the next (and/or previous).
		- Types:
			- Singly Linked List
			- Doubly Linked List
			- Circular Linked List
	- Stack
		- Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) structure.
		- Operations: push(), pop(), peek().
		- Example: Function call stack, undo/redo functionality.
	- Queue
		- First-In-First-Out (FIFO) structure.
		- Operations: enqueue(), dequeue(), peek().
		- Variants:
			- Circular Queue
			- Double-Ended Queue (Deque)
			- Priority Queue

2. Hierarchical Data Structures
	- Trees
		- Nodes connected in a parent-child hierarchy.
		- Types:
			- Binary Tree
			- Binary Search Tree (BST)
			- AVL Tree (Balanced BST)
			- Red-Black Tree
			- B-Tree, B+ Tree
			- Trie (Prefix Tree)
			- Heap (Min-Heap, Max-Heap)
	- Graphs
		- Set of vertices (nodes) and edges (connections).
		- Types:
			- Directed Graph (Di-graph)
			- Undirected Graph
			- Weighted Graph
			- Unweighted Graph
			- Cyclic and Acyclic Graphs
		- Tree is a specific type of acyclic graph.

3. Hash-Based Data Structures
	- Hash Table / Hash Map
		- Key-value pairs with efficient lookups using a hash function.
		- Example: HashMap, Hashtable in Java.
	- Hash Set
		- Collection of unique elements with no particular order.
		- Example: HashSet in Java.

4. Specialized Data Structures
	- Heap
		- Complete binary tree satisfying the heap property.
		- Types: Min-Heap, Max-Heap.
		- Used in priority queues and scheduling algorithms.
	- Trie
		- Tree-based structure to store strings or prefixes efficiently.
		- Useful for searching prefixes and dictionaries.
	- Suffix Tree / Suffix Array
		- Data structures for efficient string matching and substring searching.
	- Bloom Filter
		- Probabilistic data structure used to test membership efficiently (with false positives).
	- Skip List
		- Linked list with additional levels for faster search, similar to a balanced tree.
	- Disjoint Set (Union-Find)
		- Structure for managing a collection of disjoint (non-overlapping) sets.
		- Used in graph algorithms like Kruskalâ€™s MST.
	- Segment Tree
		- Tree used for range queries and updates over an array.
	- Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree)
		- Used for cumulative frequency tables and range queries.

5. Non-Linear / Hybrid Structures
	- Matrix
		- 2D or multi-dimensional structure for grid-based problems.
	- Deque (Double-Ended Queue)
		- Allows insertion and deletion from both ends.
	- Priority Queue
		- A queue where elements are dequeued based on priority.
	- Circular Buffer
		- Fixed-size buffer that wraps around when full.

6. Persistent Data Structures
	- Structures that preserve the previous versions of themselves when modified.
	- Example: Immutable Lists, Persistent Trees.

7. Distributed Data Structures
	- Used for systems with distributed memory or data.
	- Examples:
		- Distributed Hash Table (DHT)
		- Merkle Tree (for blockchains)

8. Advanced Data Structures
	- Self-Balancing Trees: AVL Tree, Red-Black Tree.
	- K-D Tree: Used for spatial queries in multidimensional data.
	- Suffix Automaton: Compact representation for strings.
	- Sparse Table: Optimized for immutable range queries.
